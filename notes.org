* Notes on tiny-http
	
** Enum Message
 why isn't lib.rs Enum Message an instance of Result?
 
** Noted Ugliness
 with_capacity(8) -- seriously? in lib.rs:
        let messages = MessagesQueue::with_capacity(8);
 in task_pool.rs: DOS threat:
   /// A new thread is created every time all the existing threads are full.
